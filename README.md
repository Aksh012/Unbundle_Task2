Once again Hello Unbundle ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹, I am Akshat a Web developer from college Of Engineering Roorkee.
For this project I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for CSS frame work I prefer Bootstrap 5.
For basic Frame of this project I use HTML and to give a good user interface I use CSS and Bootstrap 5.
The main work is all done by JavaScript, to dynamicall add chocolate is use HTML but to automatically update the cart and the checkout button I created a function for both.
I also use Google Api to store data and display it on the nexy cart page
